# TextmagicClient.UploadMessageAttachmentResponse

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**chars** | **Number** | `href` field characters count.  | 
**href** | **String** | This is a relative link to your file. To construct a full link, just add “[https://my.textmagic.com/”](https://my.textmagic.com/%E2%80%9D) to the beginning (like this: [https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9)). For most modern devices, you can omit the “https://” part and write just [my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9), which will save you 8 characters.  | 
**name** | **String** | File name of the uploaded file.  | 
**size** | **Number** | Attachment size in bytes. | 
**resource** | **String** | Internal file name |
