# TextMagic BASH Wrapper

## What Is TextMagic?
TextMagic’s application programming interface (API) provides the communication link between your application and TextMagic’s SMS Gateway, allowing you to send and receive text messages and to check the delivery status of text messages you’ve already sent.
